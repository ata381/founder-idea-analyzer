Title: Iteration 1 — Heuristic Insight Engine

Description:
Create/verify `lib/insightEngine.js` that deterministically computes 6-dimension scores and drafts a Lean Canvas from submitted idea fields.

Acceptance criteria:
- Outputs numeric scores 0–100 for the six dimensions.
- Returns a `leanCanvas` object containing the standard fields.
- Deterministic and offline (no external API calls).

Notes:
The repo already contains a simple engine; review, document, and add unit tests if time allows.
