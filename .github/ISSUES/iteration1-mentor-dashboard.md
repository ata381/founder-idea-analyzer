Title: Iteration 1 — Mentor Dashboard (Mock)

Description:
Create a simple Mentor Dashboard that demonstrates: awareness delta (first vs latest idea), blind spots list, and a short weekly AI-style summary.

Acceptance criteria:
- Ability to fetch at least two idea versions (or mock differences) and show delta on a small card.
- Blind spots panel shows items inferred from insights (e.g., "low differentiation", "high risk").
- Weekly summary card displays 1–3 sentences summarizing recent changes (can be mocked).

Notes:
This can be a separate page or modal. Real versioning can be added later; for interview a mockable UI is acceptable.
